# mice_x86_OS
this is a mini kernel I've built in the past to learn how x86 architecture works. the Idea is , to make an SNES-like game in assembly that booted when you turn on your PC .

to compile you need nasm . select boot.asm with binary compiling method and past over it's banary content to a disk or to a usb via a hex editor that supports disk writing.
